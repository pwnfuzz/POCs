## Description
This repository contains a proof-of-concept exploit for CVE-2025-2263, a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in Sante PACS (versions prior to 4.2.0). The exploit demonstrates how an attacker can send a specially crafted encrypted username to overflow a fixed-size stack buffer during decryption, leading to denial of service. It is not possible to leverage it for full RCE due to the protections enforced on the binary.
